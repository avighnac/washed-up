**Installation Instructions**: In order to run the game, you'll need to have the visual c++ library installed. Don't worry, although this sounds complicated it's really not. You can download that from here. (https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) Once it downloads, install it and you'll be good to go.
